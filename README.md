# Subscription Based Ecommerce Snacks Service

I had the idea for this site / service around 2012.  I thought, "Wouldn't it be awesome to be able to discover snacks from all around the world?  Just think about purchasing a subscription for yourself, for a friend, for a college student, where you would receive weekly packages of snacks from a different country.  You can take a snack tour of the world!"

So, I took a web platform that I built, and put this site up.  Concept and design were all done by me, and I got a few friends together to put up content.  Then I set about signing up with snack wholesalers.  And then the momentum fell apart due to lack of funds, and the fact that I'm much better at making a site and thinking about it than doing business and marketing it.

This site is based on an early version of my custom MVC / CMS platform: https://github.com/jasonchen736/Custom_LAMP_Based_MVC_CMS_Platform
