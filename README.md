# Subscription Based Ecommerce Snacks Service

I had the idea for this site / service around 2007/2008.  I thought, "Wouldn't it be awesome to be able to discover snacks from all around the world?  Just think about purchasing a subscription for yourself, for a friend, for a college student, where you would receive weekly packages of snacks from a different country.  You can take a snack tour of the world!"

So, I took a web platform that I built, and put this site up.  Concept, design, art, and development were done by me, and I got a few friends together to put up content.  I set about signing up with snack wholesalers, and then the momentum fell apart from lack of funds, and the fact that I'm much better at making a site and planning it than doing business and marketing.
