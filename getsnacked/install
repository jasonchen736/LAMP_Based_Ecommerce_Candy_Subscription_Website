Run database files (mysql db_name < text_file)

Edit apache_conf to local install directory and other settings
Edit httpd.conf to include apache_conf
Edit site_conf to set database and other settings
  - Leave site_id set to default unless the site name has already been registered
  - If the site name has already been registered, site id can be found in the table siteRegistry

Make sure permissions are set for site_conf
Make sure permissions are set for the template directories
Make sure permissions are set for image directories
  - When using the system core to host more than one site, it is a good idea to synchronize uploadable images by sym linking the site image directories to one main image directory (cd /core/site2/www/images; ln -s /core/site1/www/images/products/ .)
    - products
    - packages
    - offers
    - content
Make sure permissions are set for the certificates directory if using linkpoint gateway or sub merchants functionality

Edit emails to make sure they're sending (all emails must have a from and subject line)
    - businessAccountActivation
    - orderReceipt
    - orderAlert
    - customerSignupAcknowledgement
    - customerSignupNotification
    - merchantSignupAcknowledgement
    - merchantSignupNotification

Each site must be registered to function properly
  - For proper registration, the site's name must be assigned a Site ID in table siteRegistry
  - The assigned Site ID must be entered in the site_conf file in the site_id field
  - Double check table siteRegistry and the site_conf file for any trouble registering a site

Site Templates:
  - There will be four directories relevant to customizing your site templates: source, css, images, js
  - Edit the source_dir directive and duplicate the main folder in each of the above directories, then proceed to customize your site (or start from scratch)
  - The default source_dir is "main":
    - templates/source/main/
    - site/www/css/main/
    - site/www/images/main/
    - site/www/js/main/
  - Also edit the favicon.ico redirect in your apache_conf file
